            <h2><li>Frito Boats</li></h2>
            <p>Frito boats is my number one favorite food that I have eaten since I was a kid. </p>
            <p>My mom would make me this on occasion and it always made my day when I found out we were having it for dinner. </p>
            <p>Nothing beats a home cooked meal prepped by mom.</p>
            <h2 id="last"><li>Steak</li></h2>
            <p>This is my second favorite food and I love to get my steak cooked to medium rare.</p>
            <h2><li>Tostadas</li></h2>
            <p>This is another food that I have loved since childhood and continue to love to eat to this day.</p>
            <h2><li>Hamburgers</li></h2>
            <p>This is a good food that I like to eat every once in a while with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and pickles</p>
            <h2><li>Tacos</li></h2>
